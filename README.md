## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Early Growth Phase**: After launch, both the number of listings and average prices grew significantly due to early traction and user curiosity.
2. **Expansion Phase**: As the platform matured and gained mainstream adoption, listings continued to grow, while prices began stabilizing or declining.
3. **Regulatory Impact (Post-2015)**: New regulations introduced around 2015 led to uncertainty, causing a decline in the number of listings while prices started to rise due to limited supply.
4. **Market Recovery (2019)**: Once regulations were accepted as the norm, the platform saw a rise in listings again, and prices started decreasing due to increased competition.

## ✅ Recommendations

1. **Monitor Regulation Risks**: Be proactive in tracking upcoming rental regulations to reduce host churn and protect brand stability.
2. **Cost Management**: Regulatory shifts may increase operational costs and risks, potentially impacting profitability.
3. **User Experience**: Maintain consistent service quality despite policy changes to avoid negative brand perception.
4. **Policy Replication**: Airbnb can pre-emptively apply tested regulation frameworks to new markets.
5. **Host Onboarding Standards**: Enforce stricter onboarding and listing policies to align with local laws.
6. **Local Listing Limits**: Cap the number of listings per locality to avoid oversaturation and mitigate regulatory scrutiny.
